   Stability of periodic travelling waves
     in a heteroclinic-cycle model 
   ======================================

 This demo computes the essential spectrum and stability boundary in
 parameter space of large-wavelength travelling waves in a cyclic
 competition model with one spatial dimension. More specifically, the
 demo produces the data necessary to plot the locus of Eckhaus
 instability or periodic travelling waves for system (2) with sigma =
 3.2 from the paper

 Details of the computations are described in Section 3 of the paper
 and the stability boundary is shown in Figure 5.

 To run this demo, type "auto TWstability.auto". The resulting output
 files b.TWEck and s.TWEck contain the data for the Eckhaus stability
 curve and the files b.TWSpectrum and s.TWSpectrum contain data for
 the essential spectrum computed for the case that zeta = 1. The plots
 for the Eckhaus stability curve and the essential spectrum will also
 be saved as eps files.

 To restore the demo to its original state, type "auto clean.auto"
